<p>The best designs are when the graphic designer and the client work together. As the client, be prepared to give feedback as to what you like and what fits your company's image. As the owner of this design you have a personal stake in its success. This makes it sometimes difficult to let go and rely on a designer to take control of your visual image. But good collaboration and communication, as with anything, are the answers!</p>

<p>Below are a few considerations when giving feedback to a designer. Your goal is to make sure you are understood and constructive. Any designer should include at least 3 rounds of changes in their design proposal and that should give you plenty of options to get what you need.</p>

<p><strong>Before Starting:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the designers portfolio and if this is the first project, ask them their responsibility for each job and how many concepts were needed to build the final design.</li>
  <li>Ask about how they stepped up to the challenge of design critiques.</li>
  <li>Give examples of other designs you like.</li>
  <li>Describe the audience and how you want them to feel when they see the design.</li>
  <li>Set up a few specific rules needed to match brand standards.</li>
  <li>Give the designer the freedom to communicate and create using their unique ideas.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have a complete understanding of the final production and deliverable for this design.</li>
  <li>If the designer plans to give you several concepts, make sure you review each and comment on what you like and dislike.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Providing Feedback:</strong><br />
Be very specific about what you do like. But, you DON'T have to be specific about what you don't like, general statements are enough to let the graphic designer know how to proceed with the next proof. The best way to keep communication efficient is to keep your written critiques concise, verbal discussions should be followed up with written notes and all instructions should be direct and clear. Let the graphic designer step up and do their job. Their job is to make you happy, and you don't want to make concessions. </p>

<p><strong>For Designers Only:</strong><br />
I tell my clients, the worst thing they can do is say nothing. Even if the client says they hate the design, at least I have an example of what not to do. If a client gives me feedback that is not specific I usually jump in with a few questions. What specifically don't you like, is it the color, the font, the photograph or the design style? Usually if you can keep asking questions you can get it narrowed down and know how to do it right the next time! Good designers keep their emotions in check and know that nothing should be taken personally. There is always an answer.</p>
