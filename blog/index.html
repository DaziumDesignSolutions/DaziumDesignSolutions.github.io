        <p>It’s an expression that means “the largest portion”. For us at Dazium, the idiom is especially apropos as we recently analyzed our Facebook stats from this past year, 2013. Who has the largest portion of likes aka followers in our domain? What platforms are they using to share their content? What is it they’re doing that has users liking them, responding to their tweets and even reading their blogs? That got us thinking. If we’re putting this much time into our advertising efforts, certainly our clients are doing the same. And if not, then it’s time to help them develop a content sharing strategy for...</p>

        <p>Ever play a game of kickball when the person kicking wafted and missed the ball completely, thereby calling, “do-over”?  Well sometimes the relationship between a graphic designer and a client is like a game of kickball – Do-overs can save face and produce great results!</p>
        
        <p>As a seasoned graphic designer, I’ve come to believe that the best designs are produced when the graphic designer and the client work together. As the client, be prepared to give feedback as to what you like and what fits your company's image. As the owner of this design you have a personal stake in its success. This makes it sometimes...</p>

        <p>Lloyd Price sang it about a girl, but in today’s design world, it could easily relate to a company’s brand identity aka personality. Every company has one, and the designer’s job is to bring that personality to life.  If the company doesn't have any previous designs to match, or they are searching for a new brand, graphic designers will start with the personality of the company with an eye on the end goal – the best way to communicate with the audience and stand out from the competition.</p>

        <p>Did that get your attention? Or was it the graphic next to it? From titles to the images that accompany the content, designers design for attention. They want to know what their audience finds captivating and which designs they respect. A design can make or break a marketing message. It takes careful planning to get it right.</p>
        
        <p>Take content design for example. A designer must often work with content so it improves readability of the message. This applies to projects where there is more content than will ideally fit as well as to projects where more white space is allowed. Both require a different direction...</p>

        <p>So, you have a quick turn-around and you want to deliver a well-designed product – what do you do? What you don’t do is panic.</p>
        
        <p>Graphic design is sometimes a high-expectation, quick deadline service and it can be tough producing when even the smallest detail of a spelling issue will make or break a project. As the designer, meeting ever increasing tight deadlines means both taking responsibility and setting client expectation. It also means having the gumption, self-direction and creativity to make decisions, define the problem for the client and solve it.</p>

        <p>Anyone who uses a MacBook Pro frequently in multiple locations requiring at least one or more specific network configuration should hopefully find this useful.</p>
        
        <p>I got tired of always opening up System Prefs, going to Network config, and switching locations. Automatic doesn't work to change DNS servers and for some reason switching locations takes at least 5 seconds.</p>
        
        <p>After finally getting tired of doing several times a day, I finally searched around and found the command-line tool to do the same and packaged it up as part of a bash function:</p>

        <p>I created a project back in January when Grunt v0.3 was the latest available. I'd read about some of the arthitectural changes that occurred in the v0.4 version. Knowing it was a sizable enough difference, I'd been putting it off. Well, I finally took the time to upgrade. I'm glad I did, as the newer Gruntfile.js layout is a more configurable, logical, and intuitive as far as implementing newer functionality through plugins.</p>

        <p>I was in need of creating some simple flowcharts, and figured I'd find a basic program online that would suffice. Easy enough - right? Not so. It seems a simple search for flowcharts spawned all kinds of other charting and diagramming programs providing a lot more than the simple flowcharts I wanted to create. In addition to the desktop apps I found, were a couple web-based SaaS apps, one of which, Lucid Chart, already works with Google Apps and Google Drive.   Definitely a benefit if you wanted to collaborate, but I didn’t need that. Furthermore, it wasn't clear when installing the Google Apps version...</p>
