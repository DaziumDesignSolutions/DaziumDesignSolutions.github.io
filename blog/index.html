        <p>The best designs are when the graphic designer and the client work together. As the client, be prepared to give feedback as to what you like and what fits your company's image. As the owner of this design you have a personal stake in its success. This makes it sometimes difficult to let go and rely on a designer to take control of your visual image. But good collaboration and communication, as with anything, are the answers!</p>
        
        <p>Below are a few considerations when giving feedback to a designer. Your goal is to make sure you are understood and constructive. Any designer should include at least 3 rounds of changes in their design proposal and that should give you plenty of options...</p>

        <p>Graphic design is always a company's marketing message, and when completed you will own the design. In most cases designers are working either to match existing branding or creating a new brand for clients. If the company doesn't have any previous designs to match, or they are searching for a new brand, graphic designers will start with the personality of the company with an eye on the end goal – the best way to communicate with the audience. </p>
        
        <h4 id="gotta-start-somewhere">Gotta Start Somewhere</h4>
        
        <p>To start, have an idea of the specifications or concepts that fit the personality of the company. It is always good to see examples of what you like and expect. Next, a good designer will ask questions...</p>

        <p>Yes, pay attention to all the graphic design you are surrounded with daily, from advertising to product packaging, from web to billboards, you are surrounded by it. What gets your attention, what is captivating? What designs to you respect? Amongst writers, marketers and designers a lot of time is allocated to answer those questions. Everyone wants their product to get your attention.</p>
        
        <p>One challenge as a designer is to work with content so it improves readability. This applies to both extremes: projects with more content than will ideally fit as well as projects where more white space is allowed. Both require a different direction, a different way of considering options and...</p>

        <p>Graphic design is sometimes a high-expectation, quick deadline industry and it can be tough. Even in a rush the smallest detail of a spelling issue will make or break a project, and you still want it to be designed well! At it's core graphic design is for the client and not the designer. It has to match the client's needs for both the individual and the collective company. For the designer, meeting these ever increasing tight deadlines means both taking responsibility and setting expectation, but it is also having the gumption, self-direction and creativity to make decisions, define the problem for the client and solve it. This problem could be time, design, writing, style, or number of concepts...</p>

        <p>I was in need of creating some simple flowcharts, and figured I'd find a basic program online that would suffice. Easy enough - right? Not so. It seems a simple search for flowcharts spawned all kinds of other charting and diagramming programs providing a lot more than the simple flowcharts I wanted to create. In addition to the desktop apps I found, were a couple web-based SaaS apps, one of which, Lucid Chart, already works with Google Apps and Google Drive.   Definitely a benefit if you wanted to collaborate, but I didn’t need that. Furthermore, it wasn't clear when installing the Google Apps version of Lucid Chart through the marketplace how to use the free version after the trial would...</p>
